  <title>OpenDSA Privacy Policy</title>
</head>

<body>

<p>
The OpenDSA Project website is hosted on a Virginia Tech server.
The developers of this site have created this privacy statement as
part of Virginia Tech's commitment to privacy.
This page discloses the information gathering and dissemination
practices for this web site.
By creating an OpenDSA account, you confirm that you
accept the conditions of this policy. 
The OpenDSA Project may amend this privacy statement at any time by
posting the amended terms on the website; such amended terms shall
become effective 30 days after being initially posted to the website.
</p>

<h2>Information is Automatically Logged</h2>

<p>
This site routinely logs all accesses made by all users.
We use these data primarily for two reasons.
(1) To help us improve the OpenDSA instructional materials.
(2) As part of our research mission, we
periodically publish in scientific venues data about instructional
technology, online instructional materials, algorithm visualizations,
and use of this site.
Such data are always presented in aggregate form (statements such as
"X% of users of the site did Y").
We will never release information about any individual, or
information that might allow private information about any individual
to be deduced, except as required by law.
</p>

<p>
Even for users who do not log in,
this site records the IP address of users for identiﬁcation
information (for example, to help us relate a series of page
accesses).
We might record standard session information such as browser type
or page referrer data - that is, information about the
page that linked you to this page - to determine to what extent our
page is referenced by other resources on the Web.
These data may be used to preserve the integrity of our computing
resources.
</p>

<p>
We record all mouse events, page loads, and similar interface actions
conducted on OpenDSA site pages.
We record performance on OpenDSA exercises (number of attempts,
successful and unsuccessful outcomes, etc.).
We record this information for the following reasons:
<ul>
<li> As part of the instructional purpose of the
site (to record successful completion of exercises when appropriate
for a course)</li>
<li> To determine the usefulness of the various exercises in an effort
to improve them</li>
<li> To obtain information on aggregate behavior of student users, to
deduce academically successful and unsuccessful patterns of use for
the materials.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<h2>Personal Information</h2>

<p>
When you choose to register an account, this site collects a userID
and email address.
You may choose to relate yourself to a given "course" or "textbook"
for instructional and course credit purposes.
While the ID and any associated course-related information such as
scores and exercise or module completion can be viewed by the OpenDSA
research team, these data will will not be released to anyone
other than the instructor of that course.
We never display your email address, and we never share your email
address with any third party.
We use your email address only to help identify you to the course
instructor, or to provide you with notiﬁcations of new and updated
site content.

The privacy practices of other pages may vary with the purposes of the

</p>

<h2>Session Management and Local Storage</h2>

<p>
This site uses cookies for session management.
This site manages user sessions using server-side PHP. A unique ID is
used to identify your browser session. This ID is stored server-side
in a Django Python variable as well as in the MySQL database backend.
It is also stored on your computer as a cookie, which contains only
this session ID.
The cookie allows us to relate the pages visited during that session.
Session information is saved in our database and is regarded
(and protected) as personal information.
See the personal information section for more information.

This site also makes use of the HTML5 local storage mechanism for
storing information related to completed exercises and user
interactions.
This information is periodically transmitted to our servers, in
accordance with the privacy restrictions described above.
</p>

<h2>Security</h2>

<p>
This site has security measures in place to protect the loss, misuse,
and alteration of the information under our control.
Log ﬁle access is restricted to system administrators while stored on
the server.
Log ﬁles are rotated regularly and archived in a secure location.
User and password information is encrypted before it is transmitted
across the network. [THIS IS A PROBLEM: WE STILL DO NOT HAVE PROPER
SECURITY IN PLACE]
The MySQL database is protected and accessible only by
the OpenDSA system administrators.
Users should also consult Virginia Tech’s policy on Acceptable Use.
Virginia Tech complies with all statutory and legal requirements with
respect to access to information.
