This directory is meant to hold code fragments and implementation as
they would appear in a book instance. The subdirectories are organized
by coding language. So for example, if an eBook is meant to show code
examples in Java, the corresponding source code files should appear in
the Java directory. The configuration file can be used to control
which language (and thus which subdirectory here) is used to pull code
examples from.
