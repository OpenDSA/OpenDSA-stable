.. slide:: Graphs

   * A graph :math:`G = (V, E)` consists of a set of vertices :math:`V`,
     and a set of edges :math:`E`, such that each edge in :math:`E` is a
     connection between a pair of vertices in :math:`V`.

   * The number of vertices is written :math:`|V|`, and the number
     edges is written :math:`|E|`.

.. slide:: Graph Traversals

   * Some applications require visiting every vertex in the graph exactly
     once.

   * The application may require that vertices be visited in some special
     order based on graph topology.

   * Examples:
      * Artificial Intelligence Search
      * Shortest paths problems

     constraints, output the jobs in an order that does not violate
     any of the prerequisites.

.. slide:: Shortest Paths Problems

   * Input: A graph with weights or costs associated with each edge.

   * Output: The list of edges forming the shortest path.

   * Sample problems:
      * Find shortest path between two named vertices
      * Find shortest path from S to all other vertices
      * Find shortest path between all pairs of vertices

   * Will actually calculate only distances.


.. slide:: Shortest Paths Definitions

   * :math:`d(A, B)` is the shortest distance from vertex :math:`A` to
     :math:`B`.

   * :math:`w(A, B)` is the weight of the edge connecting :math:`A` to
     :math:`B`.
      * If there is no such edge, then :math:`w(A, B) = \infty`.

.. slide:: Single-Source Shortest Paths

   * Given start vertex :math:`s`, find the shortest path from
     :math:`s` to all other vertices.

   * Try 1: Visit vertices in some order, compute shortest paths for
     all vertices seen so far, then add shortest path to next
     vertex :math:`x`.

   * Problem: Shortest path to a vertex already processed might go
     through :math:`x`.

   * Solution: Process vertices in order of distance from :math:`s`.

.. slide:: Implementing minVertex

   * Issue: How to determine the next-closest vertex? (I.e., implement
     ``minVertex``)

   * Approach 1: Scan through the table of current distances.
      * Cost: :math:`\Theta(|V|^2 + |E|) = \Theta(|V|^2)`.

   * Approach 2: Store unprocessed vertices using a min-heap to
     implement a priority queue ordered by :math:`D` value.  Must
     update priority queue for each edge.
      * Cost: :math:`\Theta((|V| + |E|)log|V|)`

.. slide:: Minimal Cost Spanning Trees

   * Minimal Cost Spanning Tree (MST) Problem:

      * Input: An undirected, connected graph G.
      * Output: The subgraph of G that
         1. has minimum total cost as measured by summing the values of all
            the edges in the subset, and
         2. keeps the vertices connected.

.. slide:: Alternate Implementation

   * As with Dijkstra’s algorithm, the key issue is determining which
     vertex is next closest.

   * As with Dijkstra’s algorithm, the alternative is to use a
     priority queue.

   * Running times for the two implementations are identical to the
     corresponding Dijkstra’s algorithm implementations.


.. slide:: Kruskal’s MST Algorithm (1)

   * Initially, each vertex is in its own MST.

   * Merge two MST’s that have the shortest edge between them.
      * Use a priority queue to order the unprocessed edges.  Grab
        next one at each step.

   * How to tell if an edge connects two vertices already in the same
     MST?
      * Use the UNION/FIND algorithm with parent-pointer
        representation.

.. slide:: Kruskal’s MST Algorithm (3)

   * Cost is dominated by the time to remove edges from the heap.
      * Can stop processing edges once all vertices are in the same MST

   * Total cost: :math:`\Theta(|V| + |E| log |E|)`.
