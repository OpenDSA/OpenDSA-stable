Using/Installing VT Development Tools
=====================================
As a Virginia Tech student you will be using a number of tools to assist in
projects. These tools will help you submit and test your project. If you are
working in Java you will almost certainly make use of WebCAT. WebCAT is an
automated project testing/submission system. It will run your code against a
suite of tests designed by your professor for correctness. It will also measure
how much of your code you have tested and grade your performance.

Installing The Submission Plugin
--------------------------------
*\*Author's Note: This section assumes you are using the Eclipse Java IDE. It is
possible to submit WebCAT manually if you do not wish to use Eclipse, however,
the staff of CS@VT have developed a lovely plugin that integrates into Eclipse.*

Step 1: If you have not done so already install
`Java <https://java.com/en/download/index.jsp>`__/`Eclipse <https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/>`__.

Step 2: Verify you have access to WebCAT. Login using your PID/PID password
`web-cat.cs.vt.edu <https://web-cat.cs.vt.edu>`__.

Step 3: Open Eclipse and navigate to Help->Install New Software, you will open
a window similar to the below screenshot. Hit the Add button (circled in red)
