Functional Programming - Part 2 (F 2/12/16)
===========================================

RP 6 part 1
-----------

Topics of the day:

  1. Developing basic, recursive list-processing functions, including
     ``sum``, ``isMember``, ``removeFirst``, and ``subst``

The review problem set for today contains three review problems.

This problem aims to increase your comfort with recursion in functions
that manipulate lists. Note that this problem is randomized. You
must solve it correctly three times in a row to earn the point
associated with it.
