Grammars - Part 5 (W 2/10/16)
=============================

RP 5 part 1
-----------

Topics of the day:

  1. How to add annotations to a Jison grammar to produce an
     interpreter, rather than just a parser.
  2. Introduction to functional programming (beginning of the next chapter).

The review problem set for today contains five review problems.  The
first one (see below) is about grammars. The four remaining problems are in
the chapter on functional programming.

This first problem will help you understand how annotated Jison grammars
can be used to generate interpreters.
