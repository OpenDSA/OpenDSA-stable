Beta-Reduction
==============

Section Text
------------

Section text is forthcoming.

RP 16 Part 1
------------

This randomized problem will help you identify :math:`\beta`-redexes.  To earn
credit for it, you will have to solve it correctly three times in a
row.

RP 16 Part 2
------------

This randomized problem will help you identify :math:`\beta`-redexes
and prepare to reduce them by determining whether an
:math:`\alpha`-conversion is needed.  To earn credit for it, you will
have to solve it correctly three times in a row.
