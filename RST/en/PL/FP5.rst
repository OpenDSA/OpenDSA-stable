Functional Programming - Part 5 (F 2/19/16)
===========================================

RP 9 part 1
-----------

Topics of the day:

  1. Scoping (in general and in JS)
  2. Static versus dynamic binding
  3. Higher-order functions
  4. Closures 
  5. Anonymous functions

The review problem set for today contains four review problems.

This first problem is about higher-order functions and uses closures
and anonymous functions. This problem is randomized. You must solve it
correctly three times in a row.
