Binary Trees Chapter Introduction
=================================

:term:`Tree` structures enable efficient access and efficient update to
large collections of data.
:term:`Binary trees` in particular are widely used and relatively easy to
implement.
But binary trees are useful for many things besides searching.
Just a few examples of applications that trees can speed up include
prioritizing jobs, describing mathematical expressions and the
syntactic elements of computer programs,
or organizing the information needed to drive data compression
algorithms.

This chapter begins with terminology used for discussing binary trees,
some basic theorems to help with analyzing space requirements.
Tree traversals are covered in Module :numref:`<BinaryTreeTraversal>`.
Modue :numref:`<Composite>' discusses alternate designs for
implementing tree structures, whild Module :numref:`<TreeNodeSpaace>`
shows how to compute space requirements depending on the node
implementation.
The chapter then treats various examples of binary trees.
