Reduction of Hamiltonian Cycle to Traveling Salesman
====================================================

Hamiltonian Cycle to Traveling Salesman
---------------------------------------

The following slideshow shows that an instance of Hamiltonian Cycle 
problem can be reduced to an instance of Traveling Salesman problem in 
polynomial time.
