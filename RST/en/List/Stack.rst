Stacks
======

Stack terminology
-----------------

The :term:`stack` is a list-like structure
in which elements may be inserted or removed from only one end.
While this restriction makes stacks less flexible than lists,
it also makes stacks both efficient (for those operations they can do)
and easy to implement.
Many applications require only the limited form of
insert and remove operations that stacks provide.
In such cases, it is more efficient to use the simpler stack data
structure rather than the generic list.
For example, the freelist of Module :numref:`<Freelist>` is really a
stack.

Despite their restrictions, stacks have many uses.
Thus, a special vocabulary for stacks has developed.
Accountants used stacks long before the invention of the computer.
They called the stack a "LIFO" list,
which stands for "Last-In, First-Out."
Note that one implication of the LIFO policy is that stacks
remove elements in reverse order of their arrival.

The accessible element of the stack is called the ``top`` element.
Elements are not said to be inserted, they are :term:`pushed` onto the
stack.
When removed, an element is said to be :term:`popped` from the stack.
Here is a simple stack ADT.

   :tag: Stack

As with lists, there are many variations on stack implementation.
The two approaches presented here are the :term:`array-based stack`
and the :term:`linked stack`, 
which are analogous to array-based and linked lists, respectively.

Array-Based Stacks
------------------

Here is a complete implementation for
the array-based stack class.

.. codeinclude:: Lists/AStack.pde
   :tag: AStack1,AStack2

.. inlineav:: AStackVarCON ss
   :output: show
   
The array-based stack implementation is essentially
a simplified version of the array-based list.
The only important design decision to be made is which end of the
array should represent the top of the stack.

.. inlineav:: AStackPushCON ss
   :output: show

.. inlineav:: AStackPopCON ss
   :output: show

Linked Stacks
-------------

The linked stack implementation is quite simple.
The freelist of Module :numref:`<Freelist>` is an example
of a linked stack.
Elements are inserted and removed only from the head of the list.
A header node is not used because no special-case code is required
for lists of zero or one elements.
Here is the complete linked stack implementation.

Comparison of Array-Based and Linked Stacks
-------------------------------------------

All operations for the array-based and linked stack implementations
take constant time, so from a time efficiency perspective,
neither has a significant advantage.
Another basis for comparison is the total space
required.
The analysis is similar to that done for list implementations.
The array-based stack must declare a fixed-size array initially, and
some of that space is wasted whenever the stack is not full.
The linked stack can shrink and grow but requires the overhead of a
link field for every element.

When multiple stacks are to be
implemented, it is possible to take advantage of the one-way growth of
the array-based stack.
This can be done by using a single array to store two stacks.
One stack grows inward from each end as illustrated by
Figure :num:`Figure #TwoArrayStacks`, hopefully leading to less wasted
space.
However, this only works well when the space requirements of the two
stacks are inversely correlated.
In other words, ideally when one stack grows, the other will shrink.
This is particularly effective when elements are taken from
one stack and given to the other.
If instead both stacks grow at the same time, then the free space
in the middle of the array will be exhausted
quickly.

   toward the middle.
