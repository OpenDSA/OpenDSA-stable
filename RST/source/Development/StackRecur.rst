Implementing Recursion [Text]
=============================

WARNING! You should not read this section unless you are already
comfortable with implementing recursive functions.
One of the biggest hang-ups for students learning recursion is too
much focus on the recursive "process".
As decribed in Module :numref:`<Recursion>`, the right way to think
about recursion is to just think about the return value that the
recursive call gives back
Thinking about *how* that answer is computed just gets in the way.
While there a good reasons to understand how recursion is implemented,
helping you to write recursive functions is not one of them.

Perhaps the most common computer application that uses stacks is not
even visible to its users.
This is the implementation of subroutine calls in most programming
language runtime environments.
A subroutine call is normally implemented by placing necessary
information about the subroutine (including the return address,
parameters, and local variables) onto a stack.
This information is called an
:dfn:`activation record`.
Further subroutine calls add to the stack.
Each return from a subroutine pops the top activation record
off the stack.
Figure :num:`Figure #RecurStack` illustrates the implementation of
the recursive factorial function of Module :numref:`<Recursion>`
from the runtime environment's point of view.

   :alt: Implementing recursion with a stack

   Implementing recursion with a stack.
   :math:`\beta` values indicate the address of the program
   instruction to return to after completing the current function
   call.
   On each recursive function call to ``fact``
   (as implemented in Module :numref:`<Recursion>`), both the return
   address and the current value of \Cref{n} must be saved.
   Each return from ``fact`` pops the top activation record off the
   stack.

Consider what happens when we call ``fact`` with the value 4.
We use :math:`\beta` to indicate the address of the program
instruction where the call to ``fact`` is made.
Thus, the stack must first store the address :math:`\beta`, and the
value 4 is passed to ``fact``.
Next, a recursive call to ``fact`` is made, this time with value 3.
We will name the program address from which the call is
made :math:`\beta_1`.
The address :math:`\beta_1`, along with the current value for
:math:`n` (which is 4), is saved on the stack.
Function ``fact`` is invoked with input parameter 3.

In similar manner, another recursive call is made with input
parameter 2, requiring that the address from which the call is made
(say :math:`\beta_2`) and the current value for :math:`n` (which is 3)
are stored on the stack.
A final recursive call with input parameter 1 is made, requiring that
the stack store the calling address (say :math:`\beta_3`) and current
value (which is 2).

At this point, we have reached the base case for ``fact``, and so
the recursion begins to unwind.
Each return from ``fact`` involves popping the stored value for
:math:`n` from the stack, along with the return address from the
function call.
The return value for ``fact`` is multiplied by the restored value
for :math:`n`, and the result is returned.

Because an activation record must be created and placed onto the stack
for each subroutine call, making subroutine calls is a relatively
expensive operation. 
While recursion is often used to make implementation easy and clear,
sometimes you might want to eliminate the overhead imposed by the
recursive function calls.
In some cases, such as the factorial
function of Module :numref:`<Recursion>`,
recursion can easily be replaced by iteration.

.. _StackFact:

.. topic:: Example

   As a simple example of replacing recursion with a stack, consider
   the following non-recursive version of the factorial function.

   .. codeinclude:: Misc/Fact.pde
      :tag: sfact

   Here, we simply push successively smaller values of :math:`n` onto
   the stack until the base case is reached, then repeatedly pop off
   the stored values and multiply them into the result.

An iterative form of the factorial function is both
simpler and faster than the version shown in the example.
But it is not always possible to replace recursion with iteration.
Recursion, or some imitation of it, is necessary when implementing
algorithms that require multiple branching such as in the Towers of
Hanoi algorithm, or when traversing a binary tree.
The Mergesort and Quicksort algorithms of
Chapter :ref:`Sorting <InSort>` are also examples in which recursion
is required.
Fortunately, it is always possible to imitate recursion with a stack.
Let us now turn to a non-recursive version of the Towers of
Hanoi function, which cannot be done iteratively.

.. topic:: Example

   The ``TOH`` function shown in Figure :num:`Figure #TOH`
   makes two recursive calls: one to move :math:`n-1` rings off the
   bottom ring, and another to move these :math:`n-1` rings back to
   the goal pole.
   We can eliminate the recursion by using a stack to store a
   representation of the three operations that ``TOH`` must perform:
   two recursive calls and a move operation.
   To do so, we must first come up with a representation of the
   various operations, implemented as a class whose objects will be
   stored on the stack.

   Figure~\ref{TOHstack} shows such a class.

   .. codeinclude:: Misc/TOH.pde
      :tag: TOHstack


   We first define an enumerated type called ``TOHop``, with two
   values MOVE and TOH, to indicate calls to the ``move`` function
   and recursive calls to ``TOH``, respectively.
   Class ``TOHobj`` stores five values: an operation field
   (indicating either a move or a new TOH operation), the number of
   rings, and the three poles.
   Note that the move operation actually needs only to store
   information about two poles.
   Thus, there are two constructors: one to store the state when
   imitating a recursive call, and one to store the state for a move
   operation.

   An array-based stack is used because we know that the stack
   will need to store exactly :math:`2n+1` elements.
   The new version of ``TOH`` begins by placing on the stack a
   description of the initial problem for :math:`n` rings.
   The rest of the function is simply a ``while`` loop that pops the
   stack and executes the appropriate operation.
   In the case of a ``TOH`` operation (for :math:`n>0`), we store on
   the stack representations for the three operations executed by the
   recursive version.
   However, these operations must be placed on the stack in reverse
   order, so that they will be popped off in the correct order.

Recursive algorithms lend themselves to
efficient implementation with a stack when the amount of
information needed to describe a sub-problem is small.
For example, Module :numref:`<Quicksort>` discusses a
stack-based implementation for Quicksort.
