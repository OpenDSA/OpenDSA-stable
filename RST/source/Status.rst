OpenDSA Content Status
======================

This status update was written March 2, 2013.

OpenDSA is rapidly evolving and adding new content.
At the present time, the chapters are Sorting and Hashing are
considered complete and actively maintained.
This amounts to roughly three weeks worth of material in a typical
class.
Everything else that you see here is in various stages of
perparation.

We have a goal of completing enough material for a complete semester
course by Fall, 2013. That would contain chapters on algorithm
analysis, lists, binary trees, general trees, sorting, searching, file
processing (including external sorting), indexing, and graphs.

To guide you on the status of the materials, modules that are not
considered complete will show a suffix in the table of contents,
tagged as follows.

[STUB] means that there is little to no content, and the file is there
primarily as a target for a crossreference from another module.

[TEXT] means that expository text has been written, pehaps copied from
one of our textbook sources. But that text does not yet contain any
visualizations or exercises, nor any description of how visualizations
and exercises should be included.

[SB] means that the module is a "storyboard". That includes the
expository text, along with specifications for the various
visualizations and exercises that yet need to be implemented.
"Quick prototype" or third party implementations (such as a Java
applet) might be included to indicate how a visualization is intended.

[DRAFT] means that the module is nearing completion. It contains text
and various visualizations and exercises. But the content needs to be
polished, and additional visualization support or exercise support
might still be needed.
