How to Use this System
======================

**Welcome to OpenDSA!**
OpenDSA is an open source project whose goal is to provide online
course materials for a wide range of Data Structures and Algorithms
courses.
OpenDSA materials are most often presented in the form of a
"textbook".
Your OpenDSA "textbook" is made up of a series of modules.
Each module corresponds to roughly one section in a regular textbook,
or what might get presented in part of a one-hour lecture.
OpenDSA content combines text and images with algorithm visualizations
for all of the algorithms and lots of interactive assessment exercises.
The goal is to let you know if you really understand what you have
been reading.

**Supported browsers:** We support any reasonably recent version of
Chrome, Firefox, or Safari.
There is a pretty good chance that OpenDSA will work on your tablet or
smartphone as well.
Unfortunately, we cannot devote the resources to ensure support for
Internet Explorer, though it usually works there as well.
At this time we have no plans to take any special effort to support
the non-standard requirements imposed by Internet Explorer.

**Registration and Accounts:**
This is an open source project, and in keeping with the spirit of our
commitment to  openness, our materials are not hidden behind a login
wall.
If all you want to do is look at modules or exercises
you do not need to be registered or logged in.
You can even work an exercise, and the system will let you know if
you have completed it correctly.
However, to get credit for completing exercises and modules
(if your instructor has assigned these materials to you to do for
credit),
or if you just want to have the system remember from session to
session what exercises you have completed,
you will need to be logged in.

You register an account by clicking on the link in the
upper-right corner of any OpenDSA page.
Registration is simple, just fill out the form.
The system will let you use any (unused) name and password for your
account.
If you are doing this for credit, then you should use something that
will be meaningful to your instructor, such as your name or
University ID.
Typically your instructor will tell you at the start what convention
you should use for your login ID.

After you register, you will need to then click the "Login" button.
Once you log in, you should see your account name in the upper-right
corner.
You can log out by clicking on the logout link.
You shouldn't really need to logout unless you want another person to
be able to use the same computer to also access the OpenDSA materials
under another account.

**Overview of major elements:**
An OpenDSA module contains a number of interactive components
intended to help you learn the material, in addition to regular text
and graphics.
There are short slideshows that help explain steps of an
algorithm,
there are full Algorithm Visualizations that go through a complete
example of the algorithm (these will usually let you set the input
data if you like),
there are "proficiency exercises" where you show the steps 
taken by an algorithm, there are sets of questions, there are
calculators, and there are other interactive exercises.

**Getting credit:**
You can get "completion" for doing the various activities.
The following activities can be completed:
going through a slideshow, completing a proficiency exercise,
completing a question set, or fulfilling the requirements of the a
calculator or other exercise.
You must be logged in for the system to remember your completion,
but you will usually receive visual feedback if you have completed the
exercise even when you are not logged in.
If you go through the exercise and *then* log in, the system will
hopefully retroactively register your completion
(but don't tempt fate!).
Depending on how your book is configured, completing an activity might
or might not give credit points, as shown in the "student view"
screen.

**Seeing your credit and seeing your current score:**
Usually an exercise or slideshow will give you visual confirmation
when you have completed it.
If you complete all exercises and slideshows for a module, the title
line should show "Module Complete" in green.
Also, the table of contents page should show a green checkmark beside
the title of completed modules.
You have to be logged in to see information about previous work.

If you are logged in, when you click on your ID in the upper right
corner of the page you will see the "student view" for your progress.
This includes a list of modules.
Initially, this might be in closed form, in which case just click on
an item to expand it.
Under each module (when in open form) will be a list of exercises,
your current score for each exercise, and the total points possible
for the exercise.
At the bottom of the page will be your current point total.

**Slideshows:**
Slideshows are controlled by the buttons at the top.
"<" and ">" buttons will back up or advance by one slide, while "<<"
and ">>" will take you to the beginning or end of the slideshow.
You get credit for a slideshow just for progressing to the end (one
step at a time).
A green checkmark should show up on the right when you get credit.

**Visualizations:**
Slideshows demonstrate a part of an algorithm on a fixed input.
The visualizations let you run the whole algorithm, typically on
input that you can choose.
The visualizations will have some parameters that you can set
(such as number of elements in an input array,
and the values of the array elements).
The "Run" button will start the visualization.
It will also restart the visualization with new, randomly selected
data values if you did not specify your own input.
"Reset" will typically clear all of the input fields and restart the
visualization.
Many visualizations have a "Help" button to give detailed information
about that particular visualization.

**Question Sets:**
Most modules finish with a collection of multiple
choice, True/False, or type-a-number questions.
To get credit for one of these exercises, you will have to
answer some number of questions correctly (the exact number required
is different for each question set).
Once you have credit, the "hide/show" button above the exercise turns
green.
You can still get more questions at that point if you would like more
practice.
Above the question on the right-hand side is a counter to indicate
your current number of questions correct out of the total number
needed to complete the exercise.
If you answer a question wrong, your progress toward the completion
threshold will go backwards by one point. (And you will still
have to answer that question before you can continue!)
Note that once you have been given credit for the question set,
you cannot lose it by answering more questions, even if you get some
wrong.

The multiple choice question sets work by randomly selecting from the
questions in that set.
It is possible that you will see the same question twice in that set,
and possibly even twice in a row.

The questions will have "hints" that you can get to help you
figure out the answer.
If you take a hint, you will not get credit for that question toward
completing the exercise.
However, you will not lose a point on that question, either.

**Interactive Question Sets:** Some of the question sets are
interactive, in that that you will click on an array or other visual
element to answer the question.
They work the same way as the multiple choice sets,
in that there is a required number that you must get right to complete
the exercise successfully.

**Proficiency Exercises:**
Proficiency exercises are graded on a point system.
Each (logical) step that you do correctly in the proficiency exercise
gives you a point.
You need to get a set fraction of the total possible points to
complete the exercise (typically 90% of the possible points).
Generally, if you make a mistake on a proficiency exercise, it will
tell you that you did the step wrong and correct it for you so that
you can continue on.
You will not get credit for that particular step
when you do it wrong, but you can get credit for the remaining steps.
Once you get credit for a proficiency exercise, the "hide/show"
button above the exercise will turn green.

**Settings Button:** The visualizations, slideshows, and proficiency
exercises usually have a button in the upper right corner with a
gear icon on it.
That will let you change some of the default settings,
such as the animation speed (usually used for things like the swap
steps in the sorting algorithm visualizations), or whether the arrays
show values or height bars.

**Enlarging Equations:** Math is rendered using the MathJAX library,
which gives you a lot of options on how you can see things.
Most importantly, if you right click on any math equation, you will
get a context menu that includes "Math Settings".
This in turn has a sub-menu named "Zoom Trigger".
With that, you can set zoom to "hover" or "click".
From then on, hovering or clicking on any equation will make it
larger.
This can really help with reading some of the equations.
