.. _ODSAExtensions:

OpenDSA ReST Extensions
=======================

The following custom ReST extensions have been created for the OpenDSA
project.

The documentation here presents all of the options associated with
each directive, as if the directive were to appear for direct processing
by Sphinx. However, OpenDSA modules are intended to be pre-processed
by a configuration script that dynamically loads in additional
information to tailor modules for specific eTextbook instances.
In particular, information related to grading of embedded exercises
should be controlled by the configuration files.
See :ref:`Configuration` for details.
Thus, a number of the directive options, while documented, are labeled
as not being set manually (i.e., by the module author) within the ReST
file. You just leave those options out when you create your module,
and specify them instead in your configuration file.

avembed
-------
NAME
    avembed - embed an AV or other HTML page inside a ReST document.

SYNOPSIS::  
                      
    .. avembed:: {relative_path} {type}
       [:showhide: show|hide]
       [:long_name: {string}]
       [:module: {string}]
       [:points: {number}]
       [:required: true|false]
       [:threshold: {number}]
       
DESCRIPTION
    ``.. avembed:: {relative_path} {type}``
      ``{relative_path}`` is the relative path (from the OpenDSA
      home directory) to the embedded page.
      ``{type}`` is the type of embedded exercise, one of the following:

        * **ka** - Khan Academy style exercises
        * **pe** - OpenDSA proficiency exercises
        * **ss** - slideshows
        * **dgm** - JSAV-based diagram

    ``:showhide: show|hide`` 
      Include a button to show or hide the embedded
      content. The options are ``show`` to have the content visible
      when the page is first loaded or ``hide`` to have it hidden on
      page load.
      **Added automatically by the configuration process, do NOT add manually.**
    
    ``:module: {string}``
    
      The name of the module on which the AV is embedded.
      **Added automatically by the configuration process, do NOT add manually.**
    
    ``:long_name: {string}``
    
      Long name for the embedded object. The "short" name is the file name.
      **Added automatically by the configuration process, do NOT add manually.**
    
    ``:points: {number}``
    
      Number of points this activity is worth.
      **Added automatically by the configuration process, do NOT add manually.**
    
    ``[:required: true|false]``
    
      Whether this activity is required for module credit.
      **Added automatically by the configuration process, do NOT add manually.**
    
    ``[:threshold: {number}]``
    
      Threshold number of points required for credit.
      **Added automatically by the configuration process, do NOT add manually.**
    
NOTES
    The ``.. avembed::`` directive fetches the AV's information
    (width and height, etc.) from its XML description file.
    This XML file is located in the directory ``xml`` contained
    within the same directory as the AV. If the AV is named
    ``fooAV.html`` then the XML file must be ``xml/fooAV.xml``.
    The path to the OpenDSA top-level directory should be set within
    ``conf.py`` in the source directory. 

avmetadata
----------
NAME                   
    avmetadata - metadata information associated with this module.

SYNOPSIS::             
        
    .. avmetadata::
       :author: {string}
       :prerequisites: {list of module_name}
       :topic: {string}

DESCRIPTION
    ``:author: {string}``
      Module author's name.
    ``:prerequisites: {list of module_name}``
      A comma-separated list of zero or more ``module_name``.
      These represent the prerequisites for this module.
    ``:topic: {string}``
      The topic covered by this module.

codeinclude
-----------
NAME
    codeinclude - displays code snippets within the eTextbook.

SYNOPSIS::

    .. codeinclude:: {relative_path}
       [:tag: {my tag}]    

DESCRIPTION
    ``.. codeinclude:: {relative_path}``

      Include the code present inside the file located at
      ``{relative_path}``.

    ``:tag: {my_tag}``

      A tag inside the source code file that delimits the block
      of code that will be included.
      Note that the source code must use the tags correctly, as shown
      below.

NOTES
    The ``codeinclude`` directive closely matches the standard ReST
    directive ``literalinclude``.::

        .. codeinclude:: {relative_path}
           [:tag: my_tag]  

    will (logically) map to:::

        .. literalinclude:: <relative_path>
           :start-after: /* *** ODSATag: my_tag *** */
           :end-before: /* *** ODSAendTag: my_tag *** */

inlineav
-----------
NAME
    inlineav - used to embed an AV (in particular "slideshows") into the document

SYNOPSIS::

    .. inlineav:: {avId} {type}
       [:output: show|hide]
       :points: {number}
       :required: true|false
       :threshold: {number}

DESCRIPTION
    ``.. inlineav:: avId type``

      Create a container for an inline AV with the given ID and type.
      If the type is ``ss`` a slideshow will be created and if it is
      ``dgm`` a diagram will be created.

      ``<type>`` **is automatically appended to the inlineav directive
      by the configuration process and should not be added manually.**

    ``[:output: show|hide]``

      If the AV is a slideshow, controls whether or not the message box is displayed
      Note the 'output' argument is only valid for slideshows.
    
    ``:long_name:``
    
      Long-form name for a slideshow object.
      **Added automatically by the configuration process, do NOT add manually.**
    
    ``:points: {number}``
    
      Number of points this activity is worth.
      **Added automatically by the configuration process, do NOT add manually.**
    
    ``:required: true|false``
    
      Whether this activity is required for module credit.
      **Added automatically by the configuration process, do NOT add manually.**
    
    ``:threshold: {number}``
    
      Threshold number of points required for credit.
      **Added automatically by the configuration process, do NOT add manually.**

numref
------
NAME
    numref - adds numbered cross references to modules.

SYNOPSIS::

    :numref: {caption} <{reference_label}>
    :numref: {reference_label}

DESCRIPTION
    ``:numref: {caption} <{reference_label}>``

    A custom interpreted text role. ``numref`` adds numbered cross
    references within ODSA documents.

    ``{caption}``      

    Text to be displayed next to the numbered reference.    

    ``{reference_label}``

    Reference name (unique) of the referenced object. Should be
    enclose in brackets (``<>``) when a caption is provided. It is
    specified via the standard ReST referencing mechanisms.

NOTES
    The ODSA preprocessor creates a table of all referenced objects
    with numbers and writes it into a file that is read by the ``numref``
    role.


TODO
----
NAME
    TODO - adds a todo box in the output HTML file, and is
    also used by the ODSA preprocessor script to create a separate
    HTML page containing the collated list of desired AVs and
    Exercises.
    (NOTE: Can also be called as ``todo``.)

SYNOPSIS::

    .. TODO::
       [:type: {type label of the desired artifact}]  

DESCRIPTION

    ``.. TODO::``

    Within the module, this behaves like the standard Sphinx
    TODO (or todo) directive. As with the standard TODO directive, the
    author should then include (indented) text that describes the task
    to be done. The ODSA version will in addition create a
    separate page TODO.html that includes a listing of all TODO
    blocks from all of the modules.

    ``:type: {type label of the desired artifact}``

    The type of the desired artifact (AV, Proficiency Exercise,
    etc). This is just a label, so it can be anything. Each
    separate label will collate together all TODO entries with
    that label on the TODO.html page.

NOTES
    The ODSA preprocessor collects the descriptions (i.e., the text
    that follows the TODO directive) from the complete collection of
    RST files to create a separate TODO.rst file that lists all the
    desired AVs and Exercises grouped by type.
    The TODO.rst file should be included in the index.rst file to be
    part of the table of contents for the eBook. 

   
odsalink  
--------
NAME  
    odsalink - adds the code to include a CSS file in the
    HTML output file.
      
SYNOPSIS::   

   .. odsalink:: {path to file}

DESCRIPTION 
    ``.. odsalink::``  
    The directive injects the code to include a linked file in the
    outputted HTML files.
    It gets the path to ODSA directory from the ``odsa_path`` variable
    in the ``conf.py`` file.

    ``{path to file}``  
    The path (relative to ODSA directory root as defined by the
    ``odsa_path`` variable in the ``conf.py`` file) to the linked file
    to be include.

NOTES
    The directory containing the file to be included should be hosted
    within the ODSA directory.
    Example, if ``odsa_path`` is defined to be ``..\..\..``, then

    ``.. odsalink:: JSAV/css/JSAV.css``

    will produce

    ``<link href="../../../JSAV/css/JSAV.css" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" />``

    in the HTML output file.


odsascript  
----------
NAME
    odsascript - adds the code to include a script file in the
    HTML output file.

SYNOPSIS::

   .. odsascript:: {path to file}

DESCRIPTION
    ``.. odsascript::``
    The directive injects the code to include a script file in the
    outputted HTML files.
    It gets the path to ODSA directory from the ``odsa_path`` variable
    in the ``conf.py`` file.

    ``{path to file}``
    The path (relative to ODSA directory root as defined by the
    ``odsa_path`` variable in the ``conf.py`` file) to the script file
    to be include.

NOTES
    The directory containing the file to be included should be hosted
    within the ODSA directory.
    Example, if ``odsa_path`` is defined to be ``..\..\..``, then
    
    ``.. odsascript:: JSAV/build/JSAV-min.js``

    will produce

    ``<script type="text/javascript" src="../../../JSAV/build/JSAV-min.js"></script>``

    in the HTML output file.
