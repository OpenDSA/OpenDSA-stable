This documentation describes various components of the OpenDSA system.
This includes the support infrastructure for authoring OpenDSA
modules, information helpful for developing AVs and exercises,
documentation for the textbook configuration system (to control which
modules and exercises are generated for a specific book instance and
how the exercises are scored),
documentation for using the front-end (client-side) portion of the
logging and scoring infrastructure,
and documentation for the back-end (server-side) API and data storage
system.
