Authoring OpenDSA Modules
=========================

This documentation discusses authoring of OpenDSA modules.
We author using
`reStructuredText <http://docutils.sourceforge.net/rst.html>`_ and the 
`sphinx compiler <http://sphinx.pocoo.org/contents.html>`_.
Modules are currently at ``OpenDSA/RST/source``.
The "book" is created by running ``make`` from ``OpenDSA/RST``.

A number of special directives have been created, which are documented
in :ref:`OpenDSA ReST Extensions <ODSAExtensions>`.

Documentation for writing OpenDSA exercises using the Khan Academy
infrastructure is in
:ref:`OpenDSA and Khan Academy infrastructure <Exercise>`.
