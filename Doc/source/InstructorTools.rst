OpenDSA and the LMS
-------------------

OpenDSA now works in conjunction with a Learning Managment System
(LMS).
Initially, only Canvas is supported, but we hope to support more
systems in the near future.
All tasks related tc class roll management, creating assignments from
exercises, due dates, and tracking scores and progress are done using
the standard tools provided by the LMS.
