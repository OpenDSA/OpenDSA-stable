<h1>OpenDSA Module Authoring Guidelines</h1>

<p>
<b>NOTE:</b> This document is <b>depricated</b> and is being kept
temporarily for historical reasons. You should be authoring modules
using RST. For documentation on this, see <a href="build/html/index.html">here</a>.

<p>
If you want to write modules for the
<a href="http://algoviz.org/OpenDSA">OpenDSA</a> project,
you should start by examining the current
<a href="https://github.com/cashaffer/OpenDSA">distribution</a>
(either by browsing the web source or by
downloading the repository from GitHub).
</p>

<p>
The format for writing a collection of modules is fairly simple.
An OpenDSA module is made by creating a <code>.odsa</code> file.
The OpenDSA Module Preprocessor (OMP) will convert a
<code>.odsa</code> file into a proper HTML file.
Actually, OMP works on a collection of <code>.odsa</code> files
contained within a specific directory or folder,
to support necessary crossreferences and linking between the
collection.
</p>

<h2>File Organization</h2>

<p>
OMP works on a directory or folder that contains the <code>.odsa</code>
files.
This directory should also contain files named <code>Header.txt</code>
and <code>Footer.txt</code>.
File <code>Header.txt</code> will be placed (with appropriate processing)
at the beginning of each converted HTML file, and
<code>Footer.txt</code> will be placed at the end of each converted
HTML file.
</p>

<p>
Within the target directory that will receive the converted .html
files, there will also be an <code>images/</code> directory that will
receive an images generated from <code>&lt;ODSAeq></code> tags.
There will also be a page name <code>glossary.html</code> generated
that contains any definitions created by <code>&lt;dfn></code>
tags.
</p>

<h3>Repository Organization</h3>
<p>
The OpenDSA repository contains the following directories:</br>
<b>Modules:</b> The source directory for <code>.odsa</code> files.</br>

<b>Doc:</b> Contains all Documentation related to OpenDSA.</br>

<b>Images:</b> contains all Images used by the modules.</br>

<b>Scripts:</b> Scripts used to process the content.
Now <code>preprocessor.py</code></br>
<b>Exercises:</b> Khan Academy-style exercises.
</br>WARNING: You can translate and view everything in the project
with just the distribution EXCEPT for the exercises.
You will not see the exercises unless you clone the GitHub repository:<br/>
<code>git clone git://github.com/Khan/khan-exercises.git khan-exercises</code><br/>
and place it as a sibling to the OpenDSA directory. </br>
<b>AV:</b> The various AVs, that are typically included into modules using
iframes.</br>
</p>

<h2>Using OMP</h2>

<p>
The preprocessor is a python script.
You will need to have Python 2.7 installed.
The syntax to launch the prepocessor is:</br>
<code>python preprocessor.py [-c=collection] module-directory  destination-directory</code>
where:</br>
<code>c=collection</code> is the name of the collection of module you
want to create.</br>
<code>module-directory</code> is the directory containing the
<code>.odsa</code> files and </br>
<code>destination-directory</code> is the name of the target directory
where the HTML files will be stored.
</p>

<p>
A makefile is included with the distribution that will process all of
the modules distributed in the Modules subdirectory.
</p>

<p>
<b>OMP Error messages:</b></br>
<code>ERROR: When saving html file</code> or <code>ERROR: When saving
glossary file</code> or <code>ERROR: When saving temporary glossary
file</code>:
These indicate a permission error.
You should make sure that you have read and write permission on the
target directory.</br>
<b>Warning messages:</b></br>
<code>WARNING: Reference missing</code>: This indicates that you are
referencing a resource (module, image, equation, etc.) using an
<code>&lt;ODSAref></code> tag that does not
exist or at least is not present in the collection.
The name of the resource is provided with the warning message.
</p>

<h2>External variables</h2>

<p>
OMP maintains certain information that is accessible from within the
module.
These are referred to in this documentation as <dfn>external</dfn>
variables.

<p>
A module collection has defined an external variable
<code>{collection}</code>, which gives the title for
the collection (i.e., the "book" or "course" title when everything is
bound together).
This is given by the collection creater as a parameter to the
preprocessor.
It is accessed within a module using the <code>&lt;ODSAcollection></code>
tag.
<p>

<p>
<code>{collectionURL}</code> is the base URL for the collection.
This is also given by the creator as a parameter to the preprocessor.
It is accessed within a module using the <code>&lt;ODSAurl></code>
tag.
<p>

<p>
OMP assigns a number to each module, referred to within this manual as
<code>{modulenumber}</code>.
It can be accessed within the module using the
<code>&lt;ODSAmodnum></code> tag.
Modules in the collection are numbered consecutively starting with 1.
At some point we will figure out a way for the collection creator to
control the ordering.
For now, OMP will generate the module numbers in some legitimate
topological ordering.
</p>


<h2>ODSA Tags</h2>

<p>
A number of tags have been defined that control the behavior of the
preprocessor.
All such tags are of the form <code>ODSAxxx</code> (and so are
referred to as "ODSA tags").
OMP works by going through the collection of <code>.odsa</code> files
looking for ODSA tags, and replaces each one as appropriate.
OMP will also attach a header block and a footer block to the file.
The end result is an HTML file with all ODSA tags replaced.
</p>


<p>
<code>&lt;ODSAtitle>{title}&lt;/ODSAtitle></code> defines the title of
the module.
This will automatically appear at the top of the module within
<code>&lt;h1>&lt;/h1></code> tags.
</p>

<p>
<code>&lt;ODSAgettitle/></code> is replaced by the defined title of
the current module.
This is used in <code>Header.txt</code> to help set the page title.
<code>&lt;ODSAgettitle "{module}"></code> is replaced by the defined
title of the specified <code>{module}</code>.
</p>

<code>&lt;ODSAauthor>{author}&lt;/ODSAtitle></code> defines the
author(s) of the module.
This will automatically appear in the copyright line in the module
footer.
</p>

<p>
<code>&lt;ODSAgetauthor/></code> is replaced by the defined author(s)
of the current module.
This is used in <code>Footer.txt</code> to help set the copyright
line.
</p>

<code>&lt;ODSAyear>{year}&lt;/ODSAtitle></code> defines the
year of "publication" for the module.
This will automatically appear in the copyright line in the module
footer.
</p>

<p>
<code>&lt;ODSAgetauthor/></code> is replaced by the defined year
of the current module.
This is used in <code>Footer.txt</code> to help set the copyright
line.
</p>

<p>
<code>&lt;ODSAcollection/></code> is replaced by the value of
<code>{collection}</code>.
This is used in <code>Header.txt</code>.
</p>

<p>
<code>&lt;ODSAdate/></code> is replaced by the current date.
This is used in <code>Footer.txt</code>.
</p>

<p>
<code>&lt;ODSAtime/></code> is replaced by the current time.
This is used in <code>Footer.txt</code>.
</p>

<p>
<code>&lt;ODSAmodnum></code> accesses the current module's ID number.
</p>

<p>
<code>&lt;ODSAprereq "{module}" /></code> defines
<code>{module}</code> to be a prerequisite for the
current module in the Knowledge Map.
<code>{module}</code> must be a file name for some selected module in
the collection, otherwise OMP will give a warning.
</p>

<p>
<code>&lt;ODSAurl/></code> accesses the <code>{collectionURL}</code>
external variable.
</p>

<p>
<code>&lt;ODSAref "{module}" /></code> defines a link to another
module.
<code>{module}</code> must be a file name for some selected module in
the collection.
The result will be to place the following text into the HTML file:
<code>&lt;a href="{collectionURL}/{module}.html">{modulenumber}&lt;/a></code>.
</p>

<p>
<code>&lt;dfn>{phrase}&lt;/dfn></code> defines a word or phrase to add
to the glossary.
The glossary is a separate file that is created as part of
processing the <code>.odsa</code> file collection.
Each word in the glossary appears along with its module title,
and has a link back to the point in the module
where the <code>&lt;dfn></code> tag was placed.
It is OK if the same word or phrase is "defined" multiple times, there
will simply be multiple appearances of the word in the glossary.
For example, "edge" can be defined both for trees and for graphs.
The glossary terms should appear in alphabetical order.
Note that this tag does not use the "ODSA" prefix naming convention
since <code><dfn></dfn></code> is part of the HTML5 standard.
But we list it here since it does affect the preprocessor.
</p>

<p>
<code>&lt;ODSAif "{module}">{HTML}&lt;/ODSAif></code>
defines a block of text that appears only if <code>{module}</code> is
part of this collection.
This supports the idea of a large collection of available modules,
not of all of which are used in a given module collection.
</p>

<p>
<code>&lt;ODSAfig "{label}" /></code> defines a label for a figure.
This label is associated with the figure counter, which starts at 1
with each module.
At the place where the <code>&lt;ODSAfig></code> tag appears,
it is replaced with the text
<code>Figure {modulenumber}.{figurenumber}</code>.
The figure can be reference later with a
<code>&lt;ODSAref "{label}" /></code> tag,
at which point it will be replaced with
<code>{modulenumber}.{figurenumber}</code>.
</p>

<p>
<code>&lt;ODSAtable "{label}" /></code> defines a label for a table.
This label is associated with the table counter, which starts at 1
with each module.
At the place where the <ODSAtable> tag appears, it is replaced with
the text <code>Table {modulenumber}.{tablenumber}</code>.
The table can be reference later with a
<code>&lt;ODSAref "{label}" /></code> tag,
at which point it will be replaced with
<code>{modulenumber}.{tablenumber}</code>.
</p>

<p>
<code>&lt;ODSAtheorem "{label}" /></code> defines a label for a
theorem.
This label is associated with the figure counter, which starts at 1
with each module.
At the place where the <code>&lt;ODSAtheorem></code> tag appears,
it is replaced with the text
<code>Theorem {modulenumber}.{theoremnumber}</code>.
The theorem can be reference later with an
<code>&lt;ODSAref "{label}" /></code> tag,
at which point it will be replace with
<code>{modulenumber}.{theoremnumber}</code>.
</p>

<p>
<code>&lt;ODSAeq ["display"|"{label}"]>{LaTeX}&lt;/ODSAeq></code>
provides support for latex equations.
The equation will be replaced by an image.
There are three forms.
The first form is <code>&lt;ODSAeq>{LaTeX}&lt;/ODSAeq></code>,
which will put the resulting image inline.
The second form is
<code>&lt;ODSAeq "display">{LaTeX}&lt;/ODSAeq></code>,
which will  put the equation in display mode
(i.e., on a separate line with a bit of space above and below).
The third form is 
<code>&lt;ODSAeq "{label}">{LaTeX}&lt;/ODSAeq></code>
where <code>{label}</code> is anything other than
<code>"display"</code>.
In this case, the equation is presented in display mode with
<code>({modulenumber}.{equationnumber})</code>
to the right of the equation.
In this third form, the equation can be referenced later with an
<code>&lt;ODSAref "{label}" /></code> tag,
at which point it will be replace with
"{modulenumber}.{equationnumber}".

<p>
<code>&lt;ODSAembed ["hide"] [{label}]>{filename}&lt;/ODSAembed></code>
allows the module author to conveniently embed AVs and exercises.
Optional parameter <code>"hide"</code> determines whether the embedded
resource appears on the page, or whether it is associated with a
hide/show button whose initial state is to hide the embedded resource.
Optional parameter <code>{label}</code> is a string that appears as
the label on the show/hide button. <code>{filename}</code> is the name 
of the AV or exercise and should not contain <code>"+"</code> (plus) sign 
in it.
</p>


<h2>Other OpenDSA Markup Conventions</h2>

<p>
For consistency across the OpenDSA project, modules should adhere to
the following markup conventions.
</p>

<p>
Definitions should be marked as
<code>&lt;dfn>{phrase}&lt;/dfn></code>.
<code>{phrase}</code> will appear in bold font, and it will appear in
the glossary page.
</p>

<p>
Text that should be emphesized (typically appearing as italic in a
printed book) should be enclosed in &lt;em>&lt;/em> tags.
</p>

<p>
There are three types of variable recognized within text.
Simple objects such as the name of a node in a tree or a graph
should be marked up with <code>&lt;var>&lt;/var></code> tags.
This will appear in italic font.
Complex objects such as a tree
should be marked up with
<code>&lt;var class="cvar">&lt;/var></code> tags.
This will appear in bold font.
Bits of sourcecode such as the name of a program variable or method
should be marked up as <code>&lt;code>&lt;\code></code>.
This will appear in typewriter font.
