          stable sorting algorithm?</p>

            <p>"Stable" has nothing to do with how fast an algorithm is.</p>
            <p>It refers to maintaining the relative order of records
            with equal key values.</p>
            <p>In some applications, we require that records with equal
            key value preserve the relative order of those records.</p>
