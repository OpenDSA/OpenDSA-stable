      <p class="question">In Shellsort, how are the sublists sorted?</p>
      <div class="solution"><var>"Using Insertion Sort because Shellsort generally makes each subarray reasonably close to sorted"</var></div>
      <ul class="choices">
        <li><var>"Using any sort that you like, it doesn't matter so long as they are sorted"</var></li>
        <li><var>"Using Quicksort, because this is generally the fastest sort"</var></li>
        <li><var>"Using bubble sort since that is the most appropriate sort in this situation"</var>
        <li><var>"Using Shellsort since this is a recursive algorithm"</var>
      </ul>
      <div class="hints">
        <p>Shellsort isn't really recursive, is it?</p>
        <p>The sort that you use on sublists really does matter.</p>
        <p>Do you remember why Shellsort sorts sublists?</p>
        <p>Recall that the main purpose for sorting sublists in the
           first place is to make the list closer to sorted.</p>
        <p>Which sorting algorithm is fast when it sorts a list
          already nearly sorted?</p>
