        <p class="question">
          A company wants to use a system where they randomly assign
          each customer a 9-digit ID (so there are 1 billion
          possible ID numbers). Of course, there is a chance that two
          customers will be assigned the same ID. But the company
          figures that risk is OK if the odds are small enough. They
          expect to assign IDs to 1000 customers. The chance of a
          collision is therefore one in a million.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="solution"><var>"False"</var></div>
      <ul class="choices" data-category="true">
	<li><var>"True"</var></li>
	<li><var>"False"</var></li>
      </ul>
      <div class="hints">
	<p>While it is true that the last customer given an ID has
	about one chance in a million of sharing it with another
	customer (actually, the chance is 999/1,000,000,000 if 999 IDs
	are already assigned)...</p>
        <p>... this logic does not account for the fact that any of the
        previous 998 assignments might also have caused a
        collision.</p>
        <p>So the chance for a collision is rather higher than one in
        a million.</p>
