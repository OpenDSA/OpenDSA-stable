	  <p>This question does not ask what AFFECTS the cost. It
	     asks what is a MEASURE of the cost.</p>
	  <p>The number of records affects the cost, but it does not
	    measure the cost.</p>
	  <p>The memory size affects the cost, but it does not measure the cost.</p>
	  <p>Records being out of order can increase the cost, but not measure it.</p>
