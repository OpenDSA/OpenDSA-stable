      <p class="question">When selecting a pivot value, a simple thing
       to do is to always pick from the same place in the
       partition. If we use this approach, does it matter whether we
       always pick from the first position in the partition, the last
       position in the partition, or the middle position in the
       partition?</p>
      <div class="solution"><var>"It is much better to pick the middle value"</var></div>
      <ul class="choices">
	<li><var>"It is much better to pick the first value"</var></li>
	<li><var>"It is much better to pick the last value"</var></li>
	<li><var>"It doesn't really matter, they are all equally good or bad"</var></li>
      </ul>
      <div class="hints">
	<p>If you pick the first or last one, then sorted input will
	  give the worst case performance.</p>
	<p>If you pick the middle value, then it is still possible to
          get worst-case performance.</p>
        <p>But to do so requires a very specific and unusual
          permuation that will normally occur very rarely.</p>
	<p>In theory, all permuations are equally likely. But in
         practice, the sorted input is much more likely to occur.</p>
