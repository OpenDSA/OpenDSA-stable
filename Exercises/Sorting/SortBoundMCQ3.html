      <p class="question">If the upper and lower bounds for a problem meet then:</p>
      <div class="solution">
         <var>"We can say that we understand the runtime cost of the problem"</var>
      </div>
        <ul class="choices">
          <li><var>"We are ready to implement the solution to the problem"</var></li>
          <li><var>"The universe explodes"</var></li>
          <li><var>The problem is <code>\Theta(n)</code></var></li>
        </ul>
	<div class="hints">
	  <p>The universe hasn't exploded yet.</p>
	  <p>Just because the bounds meet, it does not mean that the
	  cost is <code>\Theta(n)</code>.</p>
	  <p>We might need to implement an algorithm even if we are
	  not certain that it is the best.</p>
	  <p>When the bounds meet, then we know for certain if an
	  algorithm to solve that problem is best (within a constant
	  factor).</p>
