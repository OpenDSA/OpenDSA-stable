      <p class="question">The lower bound for a problem is defined to be:</p>
      <div class="solution">
         <var>"The best possible cost for any algorithm that solves the problem"</var>
      </div>
        <ul class="choices">
          <li><var>"The cost of the best algorithm that we know for the problem"</var></li>
          <li><var>"The same as the upper bound for the problem"</var></li>
          <li><var>"The cost of the best case input for the problem"</var></li>
          <li><var>"The maximum cost that any algorithm to solve the problem could have"</var></li>
        </ul>
	<div class="hints">
	  <p>Upper and lower bounds are used to describe to what we
	  know, and we do not always know that these are the same for
	  a given algorithm.</p>
	  <p>Lower bound refers to the class of inputs that we are
	  considering (best, average, or worst-case). So it does NOT
	  necessarily have anything to do with the best-case
	  input.</p>
	  <p>The cost of the best algorithm that we know sets a limit
	  on the upper bound of the problem, not the lower bound.</p>
	  <p>The lower bound refers to the best possible cost (for the
	  class of inputs, such as worst-case) for ANY algorithm that
	  solves the problem.</p>
