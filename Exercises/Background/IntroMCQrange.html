      <p class="question">A range query is:</p>
      <div class="solution"><var>"Where a record is returned if its relevant key value falls between a pair of values"</var></div>
      <ul class="choices">
	<li><var>"Where a record is returned if its unique identifier matches the search value"</var></li>
	<li><var>"Another name for any database query for a key value"</var></li>
	<li><var>"A way of efficiently locating the records in a database"</var></li>
      </ul>
      <div class="hints">
        <p>A query to find the record that matches a unique identifier
           is called an exact-match query.</p>
        <p>There are many database queries that are not range
	   queries.</p>
	<p> Whether a search is efficient or not has nothing to do
	    with whether it is a range query or not.</p>
        <p>Returning a record that falls within a range is called a
	   range query. </p>
