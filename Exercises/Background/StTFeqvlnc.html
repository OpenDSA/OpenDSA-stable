        <p> A relation is an equivalence relation if it is reflextive,
        symmetric, and transitive.</p>
        <p> Is the relation reflexive? That is, for every element A in
            the set, is (A, A) in the relation?</p>
        <p> Is the relation symmetric? That is, for every pair A, B of
            distinct elements in the set, if (A, B) is in the
            relation, is (B, A) also in the relation?</p>
        <p> Is the relation transitive? That is, for every triple A, B,
            and C of distinct elements in the set, if (A, B) is in the
            relation and (B, C) is in the relation, is (A, C) also in
