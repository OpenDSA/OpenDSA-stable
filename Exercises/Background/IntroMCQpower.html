      <p class="question">As computers have become more powerful:</p>
      <div class="solution"><var>"We have used that additional computing power to tackle more complex problems"</var></div>
      <ul class="choices">
	<li><var>"The need for good algorithms has become less because processor speed can make up for a slow algorithm"</var></li>
	<li><var>"The algorithms have become easier to understand"</var></li>
	<li><var>"We are better able to use our everyday intuition to solve problems"</var></li>
      </ul>
      <div class="hints">
        <p>Good solutions for large, complex computational problems usually
           require different approaches than what we do in everyday life.</p>
	<p>As problems that we try to solve grow more complicated,
           their solutions tend to grow more complicated.</p>
        <p>Processor speed cannot grow as fast as the cost of a slower
           algorithm applied to a bigger problem.</p>
        <p>As our computers have become more powerful, our history has
           been to apply them to more complex problems.</p>
