      <p class="question">Which of these is NOT one of the three
      standard steps to follow when selecting a data structure to
      solve a problem?</p>
      <div class="solution"><var>"Run simulations to quantify the expected running time of the program"</var></div>
      <ul class="choices">
	<li><var>"Analyze your problem to determine the basic operations that must be supported"</var></li>
	<li><var>"Quantify the resource constraints for each operation"</var></li>
	<li><var>"Select the data structure that best meets the requirements determined in the prior steps of the process"</var></li>
      </ul>
      <div class="hints">
        <p>Knowing the basic operations required to solve your problem
	   is the first step to selecting a suitable data structure.</p>
        <p>Knowing the resource constraints for your problem's basic
           operations is the second step to selecting a suitable data
           structure.</p> 
        <p>Once you know the basic operations and their resource
           constraints, then you can select a data structure that
           matches.</p>
        <p>Many problems do not require that you run simulations to
           determine the expected times for alternative solutions.</p>
