<pre>
<var>expression</var>
</pre>
	  <p class="question">True or False? An &alpha;-conversion is
	    required when performing one full execution of the
	    substitution algorithm needed to perform the first step
	    (or &beta;-reduction) in the evaluation of this redex.

	  <ul class="choices" data-category="true">
	    <li>True</li>
	    <li>False</li>
	  </ul>

      <div class="hints">
	<p>Once you have identified the &beta;-redex in the expression
	given above, write down the substitution that is needed to
	reduce it, that is, replace the question marks in <em>subst(
	?, ?, ?)</em>.
	</p>
	<p>Once you have identified the substitution that must take
	  place, determine which (sub-)case of the substitution
	  algorithm applies.
	</p>
	<p>Identifying the applicable (sub-)case of the substitution
	algorithm immediately gives you the answer to this problem,
	since &alpha;-conversions are only required in one
	sub-case.</p>
	<p>Watch out! The single &beta;-reduction that you are asked
	to think about translates into a call to the substitute
	algorithm, which can make several recursive calls as the
	substitution proceeds through the whole body of the &lambda;
	abstraction</p>
