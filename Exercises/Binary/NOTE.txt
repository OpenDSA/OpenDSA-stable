DprobsAll.html is an extention of Dprobs.html includes all of the
questions that start with "D" and "T", even though it would be better to make
them separate. The problem is that it uses JSAV. We don't properly
load the support files in this case when we use a JSAV-based exercise
in a summary.

So, for now, I have put a copy of the individual problems into the
DprobsAll.html file, and load that as the exercise, rather than use a
proper summary exercise (DefSumm.html) that references Dprobs.html.
