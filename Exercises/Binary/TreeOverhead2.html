      <p class="problem">WARNING! Read the conditions for the problems
	in this set very carefully! The type of tree and node structure
	can change from problem to problem.</p>
      <p class="question">Assume that for some binary tree node
	implementation, a pointer requires <var>P</var> bytes and a data
	object requires <var>D</var> bytes.
	Further assume that we are storing a Full binary tree, that the
	internal nodes are implemented to store two pointers and a
	data field,
        and that the leaf nodes store only a data field.
	Type a fraction (like "1/2") that represents the fraction of
	the total space taken up by overhead.
	Give your fraction in lowest terms.

      <div class="hints">
         <p>The overhead is the space taken up by the
         pointers to the node's children, as a fraction of all space
         in the node.</p>
	 <p>In a full binary tree, half the nodes are leaf nodes and
	 half are internal nodes.</p>
	 <p>Internal nodes have two pointers and a data field, while
	  leaf nodes have only a data field.</p>
	 <p>The total space is therefore <code>(2*P/2) + D = P + D</code> and the
	 overhead is <code>(2*P/2)</code>.
	 <p>If you have values like 4/8, reduce to 1/2.</p>
