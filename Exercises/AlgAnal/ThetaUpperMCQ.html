      <p class="question">If we know that algorithm X is <code>\Theta(n)</code> in
	the average case, then what can we say about
	its TIGHTEST upper bound?</p>
      <div class="solution"><var>It is <code>O(n)</code> in the average case.</var></div>
      <ul class="choices">
        <li><var>"It is O(n) or greater in the average case, but we don't have enough information to say more."</var></li>
        <li><var>"It is O(n) or less in the average case, but we don't have enough information to say more."</var></li>
        <li><var>"We don't have enough information to say."</var></li>

        <p>What is the definition of <code>\Theta(n)</code>?</p>
        <p>Being <code>\Theta(n)</code> means that we know a tight
        bound (both the upper and the lower bounds match).</p>
        <p>If X is <code>\Theta(n)</code>, then it is
        both <code>O(n)</code> and <code>\Omega(n)</code>.
