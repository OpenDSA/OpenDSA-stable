To create a slide show for the reduction of the expression: 3+4
type, in this directory:

./create_slideshow.sh "3+4" a "add3to4"

This command will create a slideshow for the applicative order reduction
of the lambda expression equivalent to "3+4" and will store the slide
show in:

./AV/scripted/add3to4.html

For a normal order reduction of the same lambda expression, type:

./create_slideshow.sh "3+4" n "add3to4_normal"
