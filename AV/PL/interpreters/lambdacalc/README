Lambda Calculus Interpreters
============================

Version 1.0: pure lambda calculus with output in an HTML text area
Version 1.1: added a minimal JSAV slideshow
Version 1.2: the visualization in the JSAV slideshow is now more fine-grained
             (added more steps with highlighting of the beta-redex)
Version 1.3: switched to a single array with content being replaced for each
             slide
Version 1.4: expanded the grammar of the pure lambda calculus to include
             Church numerals and boolean constants, and operators.
