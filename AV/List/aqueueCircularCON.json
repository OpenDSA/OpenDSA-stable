      "sc1": "The \"drifting queue\" problem can be solved by pretending that the array is circular and so allow the queue to continue directly from the highest-numbered position in the array to the lowest-numbered position.",
      "sc2": "This is easily implemented through use of the modulus operator (denoted by % in many programming languages). In this way, positions in the array are numbered from 0 through <code>size-1</code>, and position <code>size-1</code> is defined to immediately precede position 0.",
      "sc3": "We will draw the circular queue with array positions increasing in the clockwise direction.",
      "sc4": "Here is a queue with the four numbers 20, 5, 12, and 17 enqueued.",
      "sc5": "The queue after elements 20 and 5 are dequeued, following which 3, 30, and 4 are enqueued."
