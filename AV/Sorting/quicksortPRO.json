Continue merging until you reach an array whose child arrays have not BOTH been sorted. Return to single element arrays and repeat the merging process as necessary until all elements have been merged into a single, sorted array. To merge an element into another array, click the element to select it, then click the position where it should be in the sorted, merged array. Remember, the order in which blocks are merged matters so be sure to select the smallest blocks first, starting at the left.",
