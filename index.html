<p>
Welcome to the homepage for the OpenDSA Active-eBook Project.
Our goal is to develop a complete online interactive textbook for data
structures and algorithms (DSA) courses.
This page includes a number of screenshots showing various aspects of
OpenDSA.
But you can also look at <a href="Books/OpenDSA/build/html">the current content</a>.
We also have a number of samples
<a href="http://algoviz.org/algoviz-wiki/index.php/Samples">here</a>.
</p>

<p>
Once completed, OpenDSA will include:
</p>

<ul>

<li >
Hundreds of instructional modules, where each
module is the equivalent to one topic, such as one sorting algorithm,
corresponding to a couple of pages in a standard textbook.
Each module is of textbook quality.
<br />

<p></p>
</li>

<li>
Every algorithm or data structure is illustrated by an
interactive algorithm visualization. Students could enter their own
test cases to see how the algorithm or data structure works on that
input, and they can control the pacing of the visualization.
<br />

<br />
<p></p>

</li>

<li>
Every module contains multiple interactive assessment activities
that give students immediate feedback on their proficiency with the
material.
This means many hundreds of exercises.
<br />

<img src="site/heapsort.png" width="400" alt="Heapsort AV" /></a>
<br />
</li>

</ul>

<p>
We will accomplish this through an open-source, creative commons
environment.
"Open Source" means that not only can anyone use the materials,
they can also access the source code that generates the materials.
"Creative Commons" means that anyone has permission to modify or remix
the materials for their own purposes.
You as an instructor (or even a student or professional who wants to
self study) will be able to pick and choose from the
selection of modules and exercises, automatically generating a custom
textbook that contains exactly the topics you want.
Since all materials are open source, you can rewrite any part
if you don't like what is already there.
Infrastructure will be included that lets you register
students and then track their progress through the modules and exercises.
</p>

<p>
A major complaint of students in DSA classes is that they do
not get enough practice problems, or sufficient other means of testing
their proficiency.
One of the most important aspects of our vision is a rich
set of exercises to ensure that the student understands the
material as he/she progresses through the book.
Our modules will contain a mix of content, visualizations, and
exercises.
We make extensive use of the
<a href="http://khanacademy.org/exercisedashboard">
Khan Academy exercise infrastructure</a> to build interactive
exercises.
