<p>
Welcome to the homepage for the OpenDSA Active-eBook Project.
We have created infrastructure and materials to support courses in a
wide variety of Computer Science-reltated topics
such as Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA), Formal Languages, Finite
Automata, and Programming Languages.
</p>

<p>
OpenDSA materials include many visualizations and interactive
exercises.
Our primary philosophy is that students learn this material best when
they engage them material and then practice it until they have
demonstrated their proficiency.
This page shows a sampling of screenshots (and if you click on a
screenshot, you will be taken to the actual artifact).
In the same way, a given visualization or exercise could be
incorporated individually into an instructor's own web pages.
</p>

<p>
But these visualizations and exercises were designed to be integrated
with explanatory tutorials, with the basic unit of instruction being a
"module".
A module is a single HTML page, corresponding to a single section in a
textbook, or a single topic that might be part of a lecture.
Modules are collected together to form an OpenDSA 
"book instance".
</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="Books/OpenDSA">Here</a> is an example book instance that
shows off some of the most polished material.
<li><a href="Books/CS3114">Here</a> is an example book instance for a
typical Data Structures and Algorithms course taken after a
traditional CS2 course.
<li><a href="Books/Everything">Here</a> is a book instance that shows
all of the exisiting modules, including ones that are not fully
ready for classroom use.
<li><a href="Books">Here</a> is a listing of several more book
instances, some of which are being used in courses at various
universities.
</ul>

<p>
For instructors, <a href="instructors.html">we have support</a> for
making assignments and tracking your students' progress through the
material.
Materials are created using
the <a href="http://opendsa.readthedocs.org">OpenDSA authoring
and configuration tools</a>.
</p>

<p>
There is a short online "course" available for people who want to
learn how to use OpenDSA to teach a class or how to develop and
contribute content to OpenDSA.
There is an
<a href="http://algoviz.org/OpenDSA/Books/C2GEN">OpenDSA book instance</a>
and also a
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?list=PL73Q3sgutLBsRPFHJTbZ1AljjDeSvPUIJ&t=30&v=it9lHdMuCGs">series of four short video presentations</a>.
</p>

<p>
OpenDSA materials are continuing to increase and improve.
Already, our project includes:
</p>

<ul>

<li >
Nearly two hundred instructional modules, where each
module is the equivalent to one topic, such as one sorting algorithm,
corresponding to a couple of pages in a standard textbook.
Each module is of textbook quality.
An "eTextbook" can be created from any
<a href="Books">collection of modules</a>,
as defined by
<a href="https://github.com/OpenDSA/OpenDSA/tree/master/config">
an editable configuration file</a>,
making it easy for an instructor to create a custom textbook for a
class.

<br />

<a href="Books/OpenDSA/html/InsertionSort.html" target="_blank">
<img src="site/Inssort.png" width="400" alt="Insertion Sort Module" /></a>
<p></p>
</li>

<li>
Every algorithm or data structure is illustrated by an
interactive algorithm visualization. Students could enter their own
test cases to see how the algorithm or data structure works on that
input, and they can control the pacing of the visualization.
<br />

<p></p>
<a href="AV/Sorting/insertionsortAV.html" target="_blank">
<img src="site/insertionsort.png" width="400" alt="Insertion Sort AV" /></a>
<br />
<p></p>

</li>

<li>
Every module contains multiple interactive assessment activities
that give students immediate feedback on their proficiency with the
material.
This means many hundreds of exercises.
<br />

<a href="AV/Sorting/heapsortPRO.html" target="_blank">
<img src="site/heapsort.png" width="400" alt="Heapsort AV" /></a>
<br />
</li>

</ul>

<p>
We accomplish this through an open-source, creative commons
environment.
"Open Source" means that not only can anyone use the materials,
they can also access the source code that generates the materials.
"Creative Commons" means that anyone has permission to modify or remix
the materials for their own purposes.
You as an instructor (or even a student or professional who wants to
self study) will be able to pick and choose from the
selection of modules and exercises, automatically generating a custom
textbook that contains exactly the topics you want.
Since all materials are open source, you can rewrite any part
if you don't like what is already there.
Infrastructure will be included that lets you register
students and then track their progress through the modules and exercises.
</p>

<p>
A major complaint of students in DSA classes is that they do
not get enough practice problems, or sufficient other means of testing
their proficiency.
One of the most important aspects of our vision is a rich
set of exercises to ensure that the student understands the
material as he/she progresses through the book.
Our modules will contain a mix of content, visualizations, and
exercises.
We make extensive use of the
<a href="https://github.com/Khan/khan-exercises">
Khan Academy exercise infrastructure</a> to build interactive
exercises.
