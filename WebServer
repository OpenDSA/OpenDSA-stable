# You cannot see the Khan Academy exercises locally unless
# you run a web server. In case you are on a machine (such as
# your own PC) without a web server running, 
# this is a little local web server that will let you test
# Khan Academy exercises locally. You only need to have Python
# installed to run this.
# After running this from ~OpenDSA, point web browser to:
# http://127.0.0.1:8000/
python -m SimpleHTTPServer
